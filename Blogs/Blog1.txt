(Ages 3–8) Big Feelings in Small Bodies:

How to Help Children Understand and Express Their Emotions

Young children often experience 
emotions that seem too big for their little bodies. A toddler’s tantrum over a dropped cookie or a preschooler’s tears at nap time aren’t just “acting out,” they’re genuine signals that your child is trying to make sense of feelings they can’t yet name. Drawing on positive parenting principles and simple ABA techniques, you can turn these overwhelming moments into opportunities for learning and connection.

Start by giving your child a safe, cozy space where big feelings are welcome. Invite them to sit beside you with a favorite stuffed animal or cushion. Speak softly as you name what you see: “I notice you’re feeling really upset right now.” By putting words to the emotion, you help your youngster bridge the gap between raw upset and understanding. Over time, this naming transforms tantrums into conversations, your child learns that yelling doesn’t “break” anything, but sharing feelings brings relief.

Next, weave in playful breathing. Pretend you’re both blowing up a giant balloon together. Inhale for a slow count of three, then exhale as if you’re sending the balloon soaring into the sky. Turning calm-down tools into games keeps them memorable and fun. Soon, your child will pop invisible bubbles on their own whenever frustration bubbles up.

Finally, invite storytelling as a mirror for feelings. Read one of your “Tiny Tools for Big Feelings” storybooks and pause when the hero encounters a storm of emotions. Ask, “Have you ever felt like Alex when he was scared of the thunder?” Let your child recount a time they felt scared or sad. This shared narrative shows them they’re not alone, and that every big feeling finds its place in a story that ends with a smile.

By naming emotions, playing “balloon breaths,” and weaving stories, you give small bodies the tools to handle their biggest feelings, building confidence, connection, and emotional literacy, one page at a time.
