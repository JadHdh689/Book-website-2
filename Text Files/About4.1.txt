Me, My Mind & More is a story-based therapeutic guide designed for teenagers in grades 8 to 11 who may struggle with self-doubt, emotional overwhelm, or feeling unseen.

The journey begins with the story of Ahmad, a teenager who learns to rebuild his self-confidence after experiencing harsh and dismissive responses from the people closest to him. Through small but powerful steps, he starts to reclaim his voice, his worth, and his place in the world.
This book is not just something to read, it’s something to explore.

After the story, you’ll find guided therapeutic activities that invite you to reflect, try, and grow, just like Ahmad. Whether you’re a teenager going through your silent battles or a caring adult supporting one, this book offers tools, language, and hope to help build strength from the inside out.
