To Know Myself is your personal space to explore your thoughts and emotions.

This book is designed to help children:
	•	Understand their emotions more clearly
	•	Build self-confidence through self-expression
	•	Discover what makes them unique
	•	Practice honesty and reflection in a safe way
	•	Celebrate their personal strengths and growth

Children are encouraged to write, draw, or reflect in their own style — with no “perfect” answers. What matters most is being honest with themselves and enjoying the journey of becoming the best version of who they are.

Recommended use: One page at a time, at their own pace.
