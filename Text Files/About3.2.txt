Step by Step… I Will Succeed! is the second book in the Tiny Tools for Big Feelings series for children ages 9 to 11.

It helps children:
	•	Stay focused and complete what they start
	•	Break big goals into small, manageable steps
	•	Build self-motivation and healthy routines
	•	Track their progress and celebrate growth
	•	Discover their own power to persevere

Through engaging stories and structured activities, this book empowers children to take action, even when things get hard.
It’s not about being perfect — it’s about showing up, one step at a time.
