To Make Sense of My Feelings is part of the Tiny
Tools for Big Feelings series, designed to support
children aged 9 to 12 in understanding and
managing their emotional world.
This book gently guides children through the
process of identifying, naming, and reflecting on
their feelings. It helps them notice the connection
between their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors,
empowering them to respond with awareness, not
reaction.


The story and activities are developmentally
appropriate and grounded in the principles of
Emotional Intelligence and Positive Psychology.
