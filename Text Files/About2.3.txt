"To Protect My Space" was created to help young children understand the importance of personal boundaries. In a world full of movement, new experiences -- children sometimes need guidance on how to protect their space in a kind and confident way.

Each book provides 15 simple and fun exercises that teach children how to recognize their own feelings, express themselves clearly, and say "no" when needed -- always with respect and kindness. Each activity is crafted to help kids feel strong, safe, and proud of their ability to communicate their needs.

Through daily practice, children will develop the skills to set healthy limits, ask for help when they need, and treat the space of others with care -- one step-at-a-time.
